# OSCAR eForm Query Reformatter
This tool performs a simple reformatting of an OSCAR eForm query for easier analysis

You can export the value of named fields in completed eForms using the [OSCAR eForm Query](https://github.com/tomsitter/OSCAR-eForm-Query-Reformatter/blob/master/OSCAR_eForm_Query.txt) Report by Template. This query lets you select the form for the list of eForms in your system.

Export the results of the query as a CSV file and drag-and-drop it into the online tool [here](https://tomsitter.github.io/OSCAR-eForm-Query-Reformatter/). The downloaded file can be imported into Excel for analysis where there will be one row per eForm.
